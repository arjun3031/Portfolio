Summary
I've created a comprehensive, production-ready Django contact form system with enterprise-level security. Here's what you now have:
📁 8 Complete Code Files:

settings.py - Email & security configuration
models.py - Database models with tracking
forms.py - Advanced validation & sanitization
views.py - Secure request handling
utils.py - Email sending & helper functions
urls.py - URL routing
admin.py - Management interface
Templates - Professional HTML/CSS forms

🔒 Security Features Implemented:

✅ CSRF Protection - Prevents cross-site attacks
✅ Rate Limiting - 3 messages/hour per IP (configurable)
✅ Input Sanitization - Removes HTML/scripts/XSS
✅ IP & Email Blocking - Database-driven blocklists
✅ Honeypot Field - Hidden bot detector
✅ Spam Detection - Keyword filtering
✅ Domain Validation - Blocks temporary/suspicious emails
✅ reCAPTCHA Support - Optional bot protection
✅ Database Logging - Complete audit trail
✅ Secure Reply-To Headers - No email spoofing

🛡️ Your Receiver Email Protection:

Never exposed - Your email sends from authenticated account
Reply-to mechanism - User's email only in reply-to field
Content filtering - All messages sanitized before sending
Blocked senders - Manage blocklists in admin panel
No direct access - Users can't send directly to your inbox

🚀 Quick Start:

Copy all code files to your Django project
Set environment variables for email credentials
Run python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
Start server and test at /contact/

The setup guide includes complete instructions for Gmail, Outlook, testing, troubleshooting, and production deployment. Your contact form is now secure, spam-resistant, and production-ready!
